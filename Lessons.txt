1. If programming late at night, if you repeatidly are making silly mistakes, just stop and wait until the next day to continue programming 
2. An idea: Once we finish a part of a program (meaning after we finish implementing a feature), seperate into its own function.
3. Never make assumptions -> test your program on every place you want your program to apply
    a. When implementing it didn't work if you did "add/search courses" -> only realized it much much later
